This game can help you figure out a way to do so!&#10;&#10;In the game, you will have a house, which you are required to provide with enough electricity. You have to provide the total amount of the electricity requirement, in order to move to the next year until you reach the year 2030, where the game ends. Each year you will receive a salary of approximately 300.000 DKK, so if you are not able to fulfill the requirement, and you are out of money, the game will also end.&#10;&#10;You will also have a property, where you can install wind turbines and solar panels, which you can buy in the shops in the game. Usually, wind turbines and solar panels can work for about 20-30 years, therefore you will not lose the ones you buy in the game.&#10;&#10;If you install enough windmills and/or solar panels you will be able to create excess energy which is automatically sold if not used and you will receive the payment.&#10;&#10;If you cannot afford to install a windmill and/or solar panel in order to fulfill the energy requirement, you can buy energy from fossil fuels. &#10; &#10;There is a battery store, where you can buy batteries, that can store some of the energy that your windmill(s) and/or solar panel(s) produce. &#10;&#10;Furthermore, you will have a normal car that runs on petrol, you will also be heating your house with gas, both resulting in an increased carbon footprint. You are able to purchase an electric car and a heating pump, which can be powered by your excess electricity production, and therefore they can help you bring down your carbon footprint.    &#10;&#10;At the end of the game a recap page will be shown, where you can see your balance, your total excess energy production, your total CO2 emission and a score that shows your overall performance.    &#10;&#10;GOALS:&#10;      -  Reach the end year 2030.&#10;      -  Produce as much green energy as possible.&#10;      -  Emit as little CO2 as possible.&#10;&#10;Good luck!&#10;" wrapText="true" />
